# Crypto Converter
Hello! I made this crypto converter app to get more practice with React. The original project that I used as a guide can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDwhJNbWka0&t=7020s (thanks Ania!). Working version can be found on my portfolio https://derekprieur.dev/. Below is a list of most of the concepts used:
## React
- import { useState } from "react"
- import axios fom "axios"
- axios.request().then()
- const [var, setVar] = useState()
- className
- td
- props
